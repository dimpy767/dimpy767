My name is Dimpy Karamjeet. I do data analysis and data secience projects to get the insights of the data.
I created a project for "Data Analytics For E-gaming" subject for My MSC- Data analysis with Business Intelligence.
This project is based on the esport "Call Of Duty - Modern Warfare".
It's very competitive game. I data was taken from "https://rapidapi.com/blog/call-of-duty-api-python/" after reading the article 
data was taken from the same website.
It has a 6000 data points. I tried cluster analysis method to create the new clusters for players "skill level".
which will further help the company to choose the right skilled players according to their ranks and make the competion alot more effective.
